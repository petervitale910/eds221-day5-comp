## Unit testing with 'testthat' package

```{r}
pacman::p_load("testthat", "devtools", "remotes")
```

write a function to practice unit tests

This function is going to find the mean value of each column, and return the lowest and highest mean

We would expect:

-  output is numeric
-  output = 2 
-  the first value \< second value

```{r}
mean_range <- function(df){
  col_means <- apply (X = df, #return mean value of each column
                      MARGIN = 2,
                      FUN = mean,
                      na.rm = TRUE)
  col_mean_max <- max(col_means)
  col_mean_min <- min(col_means)
  return(c(col_mean_min, col_mean_max))
}

mean_range(df = mtcars)
```
write some unit tests!

```{r}
#| include: false
#test that the output is of length 2
expect_length(mean_range(df = mtcars), 2)

#Nothing back is good, only will yell when something is bad


```
